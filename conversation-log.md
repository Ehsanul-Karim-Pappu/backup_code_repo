## Wake-on-LAN Analysis

### Current WoL Status
From the ethtool output:
```
Supports Wake-on: pumbg
Wake-on: g
```

This shows that:

1. Your network card supports several Wake-on-LAN modes (pumbg):
   - p = Physical activity
   - u = Unicast activity
   - m = Multicast activity
   - b = Broadcast activity
   - g = Magic packet ("true" Wake-on-LAN)

2. Currently configured with `Wake-on: g`:
   - Wake-on-LAN is currently ENABLED
   - Set to respond to "magic packets" only (standard WoL implementation)

### Testing Wake-on-LAN

#### 1. Using `wakeonlan` (easiest method):
```bash
# First install the tool
sudo apt install wakeonlan

# Then use it with your ThinkPad's MAC address
wakeonlan 8c:16:45:d1:19:cb
```

#### 2. Using `etherwake` (alternative method):
```bash
# Install etherwake
sudo apt install etherwake

# Use it (requires sudo because it uses raw sockets)
sudo etherwake -i eth0 8c:16:45:d1:19:cb
# Note: Replace eth0 with the network interface name on the SENDING computer
```

#### 3. For Windows users:
- "Wake on LAN" by Nirsoft (free tool)
- "Advanced IP Scanner" (includes WoL functionality)
- "TeamViewer" (if installed on both machines)

### Configuring WoL for Powered-Off State

#### 1. BIOS/UEFI Settings:
```
1. Restart your ThinkPad
2. Enter BIOS (Press Enter at bootup, then F1)
3. Navigate to:
   Config > Network > Wake on LAN
4. Change to one of these options:
   - "AC Only" (works only when plugged in)
   - "AC and Battery" (works on battery too)
5. Also check:
   Config > Power > Intel (R) AMT > Enable Intel (R) AMT
   - Make sure it's enabled for additional power management features

6. Additional BIOS settings to verify:
   Config > Power > Sleep State
   - Set to "Linux" or "Windows 10 or Later"
```

#### 2. Operating System Settings (Pop!_OS/Linux):

First, make sure the settings persist across reboots:
```bash
# Create or edit the file
sudo nano /etc/systemd/network/50-wol.link

# Add these lines:
[Match]
MACAddress=8c:16:45:d1:19:cb

[Link]
WakeOnLan=magic
```

Then, create a permanent ethtool configuration:
```bash
# Create or edit the service file
sudo nano /etc/systemd/system/wol.service

# Add these lines:
[Unit]
Description=Configure Wake-up on LAN

[Service]
Type=oneshot
ExecStart=/usr/sbin/ethtool -s enp0s31f6 wol g

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

Enable and start the service:
```bash
sudo systemctl enable wol.service
sudo systemctl start wol.service
```

#### 3. Verify Power Management Settings:
```bash
# Check if any power management is disabled on the network interface
sudo ethtool -s enp0s31f6 wol g
sudo ethtool enp0s31f6 | grep Wake-on

# Disable power management on the network interface
sudo nano /etc/NetworkManager/conf.d/default-wifi-powersave-on.conf

# Add these lines:
[connection]
wifi.powersave = 2
ethernet.powersave = 0
```

#### 4. Additional Power Settings:
```bash
# Edit the Grub configuration
sudo nano /etc/default/grub

# Add or modify this line:
GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT="quiet splash acpi=force"

# Update grub
sudo update-grub
```

#### 5. Test Configuration:
```bash
# 1. Check current WoL status
sudo ethtool enp0s31f6 | grep Wake

# 2. Verify ACPI settings
cat /proc/acpi/wakeup
# Look for your network device (usually eth0 or enp0s31f6) - should show "enabled"
```

### Important Notes:
1. Some BIOS updates might reset these settings
2. Your router must permit WoL packets
3. Some power strips might cut power completely - use direct wall outlet for testing
4. Modern systems might enter different power states (S3, S4, S5) - WoL might work differently for each
5. If dual-booting with Windows, Windows Fast Startup might interfere with WoL - consider disabling it
